    "The single most important thing to understand before working here: there are TWO architectures in play. The original plan (2026-08-01) designed a Pipecat-based system in /home/adamsl/talking_agent_parts around VoiceSession, ConversationCoordinator, IConversationAgent and LettaAgentAdapter. That directory still contains only the plan document. Meanwhile a different, working voice system grew inside dashboard/, and its seams turned out narrower and differently named.",
    "As of 2026-08-26 the plan's browser-side core objects have been built inside dashboard/js/ rather than in talking_agent_parts/ — VoiceSession, the ConversationAgent port with two adapters, and SpokenOutputPolicy, with 57 tests. They are correct and they are unused: not one renderer constructs a session or calls the port. Read that sentence twice before planning work here, because it is the whole state of the project. The design questions are answered; the remaining work is adoption, and adoption is the part that changes what a user hears.",

A cheap local pre-filter that skips the LLM for obviously-incomplete fragments would remove most of the 3-6s wait per spoken pause. This is the single biggest user-visible win on this page and it touches none of the work above, so it can run in parallel.",
