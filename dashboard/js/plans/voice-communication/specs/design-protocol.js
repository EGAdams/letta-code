    code: `SOLID Change Protocol   (required for every change)

  1. Reproduce first        narrowest failing/characterization test; record RED
  2. Audit all five         name the violated boundary and cite the evidence
  3. Open the GoF catalog   record the selected pattern, or why none is needed
  4. Change the smallest    prefer a port/injection/split over another conditional
       object boundary
  5. Run shared contract    every adapter for a port passes the same suite;
       tests                fakes are first-class adapters
  6. Refactor after GREEN   remove obsolete branches and duplicated policy

Principle              Question asked before editing
  Single Responsibility  How many independent reasons can this object change?
  Open/Closed            Can the behavior be added as a new implementation?
  Liskov Substitution    Can every implementation honor preconditions, errors,
                         cancellation and ordering?
  Interface Segregation  Is a client forced to depend on methods it does not use?
  Dependency Inversion   Does policy import Pipecat, Whisper, OpenAI,
                         sounddevice, pyttsx3 or Letta directly?

Gang of Four First      Use in this system
  Strategy               turn policy, STT/TTS choice, spoken-output policy
  Adapter                LettaAgentAdapter, Pipecat frame bridges
  State                  VoiceSession lifecycle
  Factory Method         PipelineFactory
  Chain of Responsibility SpokenOutputPolicy gates
  Observer               session events → transcripts, metrics, dashboard
  Command                confirmed external actions, cancellable turns
  Decorator              metrics/tracing/retries around a port
  Facade                 VoiceCommunicationApplication

Rejected patterns: no global Singleton service locator, no general-purpose
event bus before a second real consumer exists, no Abstract Factory until
compatible product families genuinely exist, no custom frame hierarchy that
merely duplicates Pipecat frames.`,

Fix: show() is now a no-op when the requested spec is already current. Two regression tests in interface-workspace.test.js fail without that guard.
