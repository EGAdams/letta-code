First, is the event kind speakable — reasoning, tool calls, tool results and status lines are not; only assistant_text is. Second, is the turn still wanted — a reply from a superseded generation is stale, and speaking it talks over the answer the user actually asked for.",
    "It holds no synthesizer and touches no DOM. The policy returns a verdict — {speak, reason, text} — and the caller speaks. That is what makes 'the March answer was discarded' an assertion in a test file rather than something you have to reproduce by talking to the machine.",
